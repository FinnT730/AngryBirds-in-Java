# AngryBirds-in-Java
This is Angry Birds in Java



This is an project in an early stage, and it will be very simple. This will just inplement the basis for the game, and make it playable. The Box class will give you the way to add a new box to the game, or a new ground. If you want more help with that, you can look at the Level01 sample. If you anymore things you want to know, you can make an issue, and I will read them (If I don't forget, sorry if I do...)
